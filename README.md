Code Kata Basic POS function Java

//Date : Feb 3 2019

Programming language Used - Java 8

I have tried to develop this project in Core Java
Since there is no scanner, the program will accept the items and quantities through terminal
Since there is no database, I have hard coded the UOM and list of Default items in the program

Program will ask User to enter item name. 
Currently the Valid items are
pepsi,soup,oranges,onions,avocado.
Price and UOM is maintained only for these items.

Based on the UOM EA or LB program will ask to enter Quantity or Weight of the item and print the price

If user wants to cancel any entered item, he can press 'X' and enter the name and quantity of items to cancel.

When the is done scanning and ready for checkout he will press the button R and complete the process.


I have not included Markdown and Weekly Specials logic as of now.
